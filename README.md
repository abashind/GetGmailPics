# GetGmailPics
I have a CCTV camera out my house, and the camera makes a picture when detect motion front of it. Then the cam send this picture as message to my Gmail. So, once I realised I have thousands photos whole the year and I can handle them, for example make movie.
This web app allows me get pictures from my Gmail as webpage (up to 500 photos on one page) or as zip archive (up to 500 photos in one archive). Besides, the app allows get only matching with pattern messages.  
It looks like:

I started this project in order to learn basic technologies for creating Web applications:  
HTML, JS, HTTP requests, Cookies, basic backend knowledges - routing, requests handling and etc.  
And I can say, I accomplished my aims. Of course, there still are a lot of TODO in this project, but unfortunately I don't have 
plenty of free time to develop it.  
And besides, I'm happy with how it works :) It's not mature product, just stand for learning by creating some applied app.
I'm going to develop it and learn new technologies in near future.
