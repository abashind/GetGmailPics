# GetGmailPics
I started this project in order to learn basic technologies for creating Web applications:   
HTML, JS, HTTP requests, Cookies, basic backend knowledges - routing, requests handling and etc.  
And I can say, I accomplished my aims. Of course, there still are a lot of TODO in this project, but unfortunately I don't have 
plenty of free time to develop it.  
And besides, I'm happy with how it works :)  
I'm going to develop it and learn new technologies in near future.  
You can see login page here: [GetPicsApp](https://abashin.tk). If you want to look how it works, please contact me - abashin.d@gmail.com, and I'll
send you login/pass for app. But you still will be able to get pics only from my gmail box :)
